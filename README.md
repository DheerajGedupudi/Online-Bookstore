# Online Bookstore

This project is a comprehensive online bookstore application developed as part of the CSEN 280 course (Database Systems) at Santa Clara University. The main objective is to demonstrate the use of a relational database to perform all kinds of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on multiple entities within a real-world context.

## Project Overview

The Online Bookstore allows users to browse, search, and purchase books while providing admins the functionality to manage inventory, users, and orders. This project showcases a relational database integrated with a Spring Boot application, emphasizing practical CRUD operations and data management.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main applications:
1. **Admin Application**: For managing books, genres, users, and orders.
2. **User Application**: For browsing books, managing the cart, placing orders, and writing reviews.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Build Tool**: Maven

## Database Schema

The database schema includes the following tables: Admin, User, Genre, Book, Payment, BookOrder, OrderItem, Cart, CartItem, and Review. Each table is designed to support the applicationâ€™s functionality with appropriate relationships and constraints.

For detailed table creation SQL scripts, refer to the [schema.sql](database/schema.sql) file.

## Features

### Admin Functionality:
- **CRUD Operations**: Manage books and genres.
- **Stock Management**: Update book quantities and inventory.
- **User Management**: Block or unblock users.
- **Order Management**: View and cancel user orders.
- **Review Management**: View reviews for each book.

### User Functionality:
- **Book Browsing**: Search, filter, and sort books.
- **Cart Management**: Add books to cart, edit cart items, and delete items.
- **Order Processing**: Checkout cart items, select payment method, and view order history.
- **Review System**: Write reviews and rate purchased books.

### User Authentication and Profile Management:
- Secure sign-up, log-in, and profile management.
- Role-based access control for admins and users.
